a = True
# The following 'print' statement will print 'a=T'
# Because for 'and' / 'or', it obeys the 'short circuit calculation'
# for a and 'a=T', since a == True, the result relies on the value of 'a=T', so the result is 'a=T'
# for 'a=T' or 'a=F', since 'a=T' == True, 'a=F' will not be considered and 'a=T' will be returned.

# The result will be 'a=T'
